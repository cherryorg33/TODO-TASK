 MERN Stack Application Setup and Running Instructions

Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js: Version 18 or higher. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- MongoDB: A running instance of MongoDB. [Download MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the Backend Directory:
   Open a terminal or PowerShell window and navigate to the backend directory.
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project/backend
   ```

2. Check for Node Modules:
   Verify if the `node_modules` directory exists.
   - If `node_modules` exists, start the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - If `node_modules` does not exist, install the necessary packages and then start the server:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm start
     ```

 Running the Frontend

1. Open a New Terminal or PowerShell Window:
   Open a new terminal or PowerShell window to handle the frontend separately.

2. Navigate to the Frontend Directory:
   Navigate to the `todo` directory (assuming this is the name of your frontend directory).
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project/todo
   ```

3. Check for Node Modules:
   Verify if the `node_modules` directory exists.
   - If `node_modules` exists, start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - If `node_modules` does not exist, install the necessary packages and then start the server:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```
